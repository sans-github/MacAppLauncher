# Deliberately NOT `--status success`. That filter is served from an index
# that lags behind the run itself: a run `gh run watch` has just reported as
# successful can still be missing from it for a minute or so, and the query
# then silently returns the *previous* build. That has installed the wrong
# binary twice, with nothing in the output to say so.
#
# `--limit 1` is not enough either, and that one cost a whole debugging
# session on 2026-09-28: the listing came back with a four-day-old run in
# position 0 while two newer ones existed, and the app that got installed
# predated the latest change entirely. So ask for ten and take the newest by
# createdAt rather than trusting the order the API returns.
#
# Then check the run's commit against local HEAD. A stale listing, a build
# that has not finished, or an unpushed commit all show up here as a mismatch
# instead of as an app that quietly behaves like an older version.
