#!/bin/bash
# Creates a self-signed code-signing certificate in the login keychain.
#
# Why: CI produces an ad-hoc, linker-signed app with no Team ID and no
# certificate. TCC has nothing stable to key a permission grant to, so it pins
# the grant to that exact binary's cdhash. Every new build gets a new cdhash,
# the grant no longer matches, and macOS re-prompts for Documents folder access.
#
# Signing every build with the SAME certificate gives the app a stable code
# requirement, so one grant should cover every future build.
#
# Run once. After this, use scripts/install-latest.sh for each new build.
